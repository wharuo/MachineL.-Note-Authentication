Example Use Case

To use the model, simply run the main.py script and provide the input data in the format of the banknote_authentication.csv file. The model will output the predicted class labels and the accuracy of the model.

API Documentation

To use the model as an API, you can use the following endpoint:


Verify
Run
Copy code
POST /predict
The request body should contain the input data in the format of the banknote_authentication.csv file. The response will contain the predicted class labels and the accuracy of the model.

Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix. The accuracy score is calculated as the proportion of correctly classified instances. The classification report provides a summary of the model's performance, including precision, recall, and F1 score. The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance, including true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Model Deployment

The model can be deployed using a variety of methods, including:

Cloud Deployment: The model can be deployed to a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud.
Containerization: The model can be containerized using Docker and deployed to a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes.
Serverless Deployment: The model can be deployed to a serverless platform such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
Model Maintenance

The model can be maintained using a variety of methods, including:

Model Monitoring: The model's performance can be monitored using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
Model Updating: The model can be updated using new data and retrained to maintain its performance.
Model Retraining: The model can be retrained using new data and updated to maintain its performance. Example Use Case
